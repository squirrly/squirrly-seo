<strong>The three things you should look for in a seo plugin:</strong>

1) to increase the chances of <strong>being found on search engines</strong>, by writting better optimized content

2) to help you <strong>measure the improvement</strong> of your site, in terms of ranking, traffic, links and Social Signals.

3) to get <strong>great support</strong>

<strong>SEO Plugin by Squirrly helps you write rich content that will be found by potential customers on search engines, research and analyze keywords that will give you a better chance of being found on google, it helps you measure the social signals that come to your site from various social networks and with one click you can check the SEO improvement of each article.</strong>


All of these help you get <strong>Excellent SEO on all your articles and measure the success of your site</strong>.

<em>"Wow ,I've been using your tool for a week now and one of my blog ranked no1 out of a million for its key word... amazing"</em> - <strong>Pierre Perpal</strong>. Pierre worked hard to get that, and even though success stories keep coming in, they don't happen for all of our users. SEO Plugin by Squirrly does not guarantee that you will succeed. It's just a tool that makes it possible to reach such results. It's a door opener.

<strong>How does Squirrly help you boost your ranking in search engines?</strong>

First of all, it's the <strong>easiest tool to understand</strong>, make sense of SEO and use. This has been our focus from day 1.

It helps you with <strong>SEO advice</strong>, in real time (as you're typing the article), to have a 100% optimized article.

<strong>Great keywords</strong> help you get ranked much faster. If you want to rank for "auto parts shop",for example, Squirrly will suggest related keywords that give you a better chance of ranking and getting visitors.

To suggest them, it checks how much the keyword is discussed on Twitter (we have an authorized twitter app for this), on forums, how many people search for that keyword, if the search trend is going up (which means your articles with the keyword will become really popular over time) and checks competition for that keyword (also taking into account the chances you have for beating competitors for that keyword).

<strong>Social Signal Metrics</strong> help you plan out the way you'll share your articles on social media networks and groups, since in 2013 this is one of the most important factors for boosting your rank on Google.

<strong>The SEO analytics</strong> (that we call Article Rank), helps you measure the improvement and impact of each article you've written on your blog using Squirrly.
